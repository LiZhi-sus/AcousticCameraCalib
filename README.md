# Enhanced Extrinsic Calibration of Acoustic Cameras Using Closed-Form Initialization and Batch Optimization
This is an open-source project aimed at calibrating the extrinsic parameters of an acoustic camera system. The repository contains scripts, functions, and data to estimate, validate, and visualize calibration results for acoustic cameras in both simulation and real-world experiments.
